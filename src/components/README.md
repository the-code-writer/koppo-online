# Components

This directory contains all the reusable UI components used throughout the Champion Trading Automation application.

## Structure

Components are organized following atomic design principles, with each component encapsulated in its own directory containing:

- `index.tsx`: The component implementation
- `styles.scss`: Component-specific styles using SCSS modules
- `README.md` (optional): Component-specific documentation
- `components/` (optional): Sub-components specific to this component

## Usage Guidelines

### Component Structure

Each component follows these principles:

1. **Atomic and Independent Design**:
   - Components encapsulate their own markup, styles, and state
   - Local state is preferred for single-use logic
   - Props are used for configuration and data passing

2. **TypeScript Interfaces**:
   - All props are defined using TypeScript interfaces
   - Proper typing ensures compile-time safety

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Components should handle potential errors gracefully
   - Use error boundaries where appropriate

### Styling

- SCSS Modules are used for component styling
- BEM methodology is followed for class naming
- Styles are scoped to the component to prevent leakage

## Dependencies

- **Ant Design**: Primary UI component library
- **React**: Component framework
- **SCSS**: For component styling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety

## Testing

Components are tested using Jest and React Testing Library following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor to ensure adherence to SOLID principles

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies on parent components
- Use React Context for shared/global state instead of prop drilling
- Document complex components with JSDoc comments
- Maintain at least 90% test coverage
