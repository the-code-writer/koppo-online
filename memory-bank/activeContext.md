# Active Context: Champion Trading Automation

## Current Development Focus

The Champion Trading Automation project is currently focused on two main development initiatives:

### 1. Unified SSE Streaming Component

A major refactoring effort is underway to create a unified Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming component that abstracts connection handling and event processing. This will replace the current separate implementations in `balanceStreamService` and `sseService`, removing duplicated code while maintaining current functionality.

#### Key Objectives
- Create a common base class for stream services
- Implement specialized stream services for different protocols (EventSource, Fetch)
- Develop adapters to maintain backward compatibility
- Ensure proper error handling and reconnection logic
- Maintain type safety throughout the implementation

#### Implementation Status
- Directory structure and interfaces have been defined
- Base implementation classes have been designed
- Adapter pattern has been selected for backward compatibility
- Implementation is in progress

### 2. File Header Implementation

A standardization effort is underway to implement comprehensive, AI-optimized file header comments across the codebase. This will improve documentation, code navigation, and maintainability.

#### Key Objectives
- Define standardized file header structure
- Create type-specific templates for different file types
- Document key components, dependencies, and relationships
- Include AI-specific hints for better code understanding
- Apply headers consistently across the codebase

#### Implementation Status
- Header structure and templates have been defined
- File categorization has been completed
- Implementation approach has been documented
- Implementation is pending

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **State Management Approach**
   - **Decision**: Use a layered approach with React Context, custom hooks, and singleton stores
   - **Rationale**: Provides flexibility for different state requirements while maintaining consistency
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Redux, MobX, Zustand
   - **Status**: Implemented and working well, but monitoring performance as app grows

2. **Real-time Communication Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Use WebSockets for market data and SSE for notifications
   - **Rationale**: WebSockets provide bidirectional communication needed for trading, while SSE is simpler for one-way notifications
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Polling, GraphQL subscriptions
   - **Status**: Currently implementing unified SSE component to improve maintainability

3. **Component Architecture**
   - **Decision**: Feature-based organization with atomic design principles
   - **Rationale**: Balances domain cohesion with component reusability
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Type-based organization (all components, all services, etc.)
   - **Status**: Working well, but need to improve documentation of component relationships

### Technical Challenges
1. **WebSocket Reconnection Logic**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring reliable reconnection with proper state recovery
   - **Current Approach**: Exponential backoff with connection state tracking
   - **Issues**: Occasional message loss during reconnection
   - **Next Steps**: Implement message queuing and replay mechanism

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining responsive UI with high-frequency data updates
   - **Current Approach**: Memoization, virtualization, and throttling
   - **Issues**: Occasional rendering bottlenecks with large position lists
   - **Next Steps**: Implement windowing and more aggressive data filtering

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - **Challenge**: Seamless token refresh without disrupting user experience
   - **Current Approach**: Background refresh with interceptors
   - **Issues**: Edge cases in concurrent requests during refresh
   - **Next Steps**: Implement request queuing during token refresh

### Open Questions
1. **Strategy Sharing Security**
   - How to securely share strategies between users without exposing sensitive information?
   - What level of validation is needed for imported strategies?
   - Should we implement a central repository or peer-to-peer sharing?

2. **Real-time Data Scalability**
   - How to handle users subscribing to many market data streams simultaneously?
   - What throttling or batching mechanisms should be implemented?
   - How to prioritize critical updates during high load?

3. **Cross-Market Normalization**
   - What approach should be used to normalize data across different markets?
   - How to handle different trading hours and market-specific events?
   - What common interface should be presented to users across markets?

## Current Priorities
1. Complete the unified SSE streaming component implementation
2. Implement file headers across the codebase
3. Address WebSocket reconnection issues
4. Optimize component rendering performance
5. Enhance strategy management features
